Chicago Crimes between 1/1/2017 - 11/12/2019

The City of Chicago offers a wide range of datasets relative to their municipal operations. Our group took interest in their crime dataset, which is reflective of crimes reported to the police in the Chicago metropolitan area. The reported crime records are updated constantly to reflect the crime most accurately, and to report whether or not an arrest was made. It is important to note that the crimes dataset entries are sometimes only based upon the preliminary data of a reported crime, so entries are not necessarily legally proven or substantiated by law enforcement (City of Chicago, 2019). 

The first step of our analysis was to export the dataset and define the data. All columns in the dataset are defined by descriptions in Appendix I. Next, we proposed our initial questions before beginning the analysis:
1.	Which areas have the fastest growing crime rates?
2.	In which districts do fatal crimes occur the most?
3.	In which districts is theft most prevalent? 
4.	How can we utilize time series analysis to show trends in crime over time? 
5.	Can we map out areas where security measures should be prioritized? 
6.	How have the proportion of arrests relative to non-arrests changed over time? 

We then targeted a timeframe for our analysis, then reduced and cleaned the dataset. We shared our dataset with the group and took the next steps in our analysis: analyzing our data and generating insights with R and Python, and creating a dashboard visualization with Tableau. With these tools we derive our key insights. Lastly, we produce our recommendations to the city and its police force.
